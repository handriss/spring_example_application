###Example Spring application with Hibernate and Thymeleaf

This is an example application which demonstrates how to use the Spring framework (aka: fancier Spark) with Hibernate (our new ORM) and with our well-known Thymeleaf templating engine.

The application is based on [this](http://websystique.com/springmvc/spring-4-mvc-and-hibernate4-integration-example-using-annotations/)  tutorial.

####How to make it work on your system:
1. Clone or fork this repository or follow the above tutorial and create the file structure and the files yourself.
2. If you added your files by copy-pasting, right click on your project in the project view, click Add Framework Support and add Spring MVC to your project.
3. At this point, the file structure in your project should look like this:
